## Reporting a Vulnerability
Report as a bug, but format the title with "SECURITY: " at the beginning, try 
to include a CVE code and link to resources if you can.

## Contributing
Be sure to check codeql reports from GitHub actions and CodeFactor reports for 
any vulnerabilities, or security defects. Also be sure to use the latest 
versions of any dependencies and libraries, check for conflicts in functionality 
and update accordingly if this occurs. All contributions are to be reviewed by 
the main repository contributors (as of now that is just me)
